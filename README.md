# Flask_Test
My project for learning about flask and some python.

I'm following along with the following youtube tutorial series:

I'll keep this code updated as I progress through the series and gain a better understanding of flask, python, html and css.

I think this is all the files one would need to run my code, but at this point I really don't know.
The template files are .html.j2 so that vscode gives them the correct jinja highlighting.
